                                Here is a little bit of information about the menu. Sometimes coffee shops can be intimidating
                                if you are unfamiliar with them, so we want to make your experience as great as possible. Every cup is made with care And
                                attention so that each one is special. Come in today for your custom personalized cup of coffee. Coffee is great warm and cold
                                and sunny and rainy. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can make any coffee or tea drink you could think of, but this is our base menu 
                                with a little bit about our prices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of our base coffee drinks, we have a cappuccino, latte, double espresso, americano, and a macchiato.
                                Typically, the cappuccino and americano don't have flavors added in, but if you would like the extra flavor
                                we can add that in for you. Also, a double espresso is just two plain shots of espresso. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have a great syrup selection, and we make all of them in-house. Some of our seasonal flavors were so 
                                popular we kept them all year. Like out Gingerbread and Mint. Our mixtures of flavors can get you a nice basic
                                vanilla latte, a cozy gingerbread latte, or a refreshing mint flavor. Try them all! If there are any flavors, we
                                don't carry please fill out the feedback section, we would love to hear from you.

                                We have several milk alternatives; we have almonds and oat. The dairy products we have are two percent, half and half, and whole milk.
                                these can be added to any drink to replace whole milk.
                            </p>

                                Brown Sugar Cinnamon: A lovely, sweet drink with brown sugar and our cinnamon syrup.
                                Typically served with whole milk but add any substitutions you would like.
                            
                            </p>

                                London Fog: A London fog is a tea latte. The tea used is earl grey with a pump of 
                                vanilla syrup. This drink feels like a warm cozy sweater on a cold day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cold Brew: Cold brew is stronger than a regular latte. Itâ€™s very concentrated coffee that is mixed
                                with water or milk. Any flavor can be added to it to sweeten it and give you a great iced
                                coffee drink.
