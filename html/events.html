                    Currently we are reading classics and this week will be Jane Austen's Emma. So, if that is interesting to you, we hope to see 
                    you are there! We will have discussion questions prepared, but also prepared for the conversation to flow! The coffee bar will be open for anyone wanting to
                    buy drinks or a snack. There will be light snacks provided. If you don't like Emma, don't worry maybe a future book will be interesting, our next read
                    will be the moody book, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte.

                    light snacks will be provided, but any extra snacks can be purchased off our menu. The winner gets a week of free coffee! If this trivia isn't your cup of coffee,
                    never fear, we have trivia once a month. The last Wednesday of every month. Our next theme will be Harry Potter trivia. So, if thatâ€™s
