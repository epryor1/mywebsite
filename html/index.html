                                Welcome to our cozy coffee shop. We Look forward to providing the best cup of coffee
                                every day, just when you need it! We love serving our small community and welcoming new 
                                visitors. Check out our events page to get social. Conveniently, we also have our menu online if you want 
                                to know what you want to order before you get here. We also take online orders, so check that
                                the area as well! 
                            </p>

                                We also have a merch area that shows what tote bags of the month we have up for sale 
                                in our shop. At this time, we can't take online orders, so these are just available in the shop.
                                They fly off the shelves. In the future we plan to include t-shirts and mugs. Both have been highly
                                requested. Currently you can buy our Logo T-shirt in store, if you want to support us.                                   
                            </p>

                                We make sure to sustainably source our coffee. The people who grow the coffe anre just as important
                                as the people crafting your drink. Craft coffee is an experience from the plant to your hands.

                                when you would like to schedual your meeting or if the room is available go ahead and use it.

                                Here is a quick video overview of current events! We believe in creating a strong community. When we befriend our neighbors, we 
                                create a stronger community. So, in an effort to create those friendships, we host many 
                                monthly and weekly events. We have game nights and book clubs and trivia nights. 
                                There are some community events we attend, so make sure you stay up-to-date and come 
                                visit! To find more details go to our events page. We also have a feedback area on our
                                contacts page, so if you have ideas for events we should include, we can gauge interest
                                and see about planning a new event. Our Board Game Nights came from a suggestion, so the 
                                possibilities are endless. Maybe tell us your favorite movie and we can build a trivia night around it.
