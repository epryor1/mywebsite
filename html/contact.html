                        Please contact us if you have any issues with an order or an experience, or if anything negative 
                    happened. We want to make it right for you. If you don't wish to call us, we have an email. The email
                    is monitored every weekday from 9-5. We will try to process your email as soon as possible, with an average of one 
                    to two days of processing time. Email is the best way to contact us with any complaints. Phone calls will not be as
                    effective as that is not possible. If you don't want to email and just have a suggestion, feel free to leave it in the feedback area. 
                    We would also love to hear of any positive experiences you may have had as well as those are our favorites.
                    The feedback is also there for any suggestions related to events, or ingredients we use. The feedback comments are read
                    daily and we love to see them. Also don't forget to leave positive feedback for your barista, as that would make their day.
                    We always strive to create the best experience for our customers. We value our customers and find joy in bringing
                    people together with great coffee. Coffee shops are a great place to gather and create community, so bring your friends
                    and start making new ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                        If you are having a problem with a current order, if possible, please come back inside the store.
                    If that isn't possible, then please call as soon as possible. Fixing it is our priority. Also, our feedback 
                    The button can be used to give us comments on our products and to request future ones. We are also looking for artists
                    to work with to design our tote bags. Also, we are looking for artists for our t-shirt line. Our products release
                    on the first Monday of every month. So, look for our new mugs on our next drop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can not wait to see you on your next visit! Thanks for being a valued customer! We
                    couldn't do this with out you.
                </p>
                <aside>
                        Our hours are typically 5 am-6 pm. We do however have events past those hours, and we also will open
                    outside of hours for event rentals. To get that set up the best way to communicate would be by email.
                    This is first come first served basis. Types of possible events could be things like office parties, engagement parties,
                    or large get-togethers. We love bringing people together.
